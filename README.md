# Proposal

                                                                    FEASIBILITY STUDY
    
    The project 'Gesture Detection'is an AI-powered project .
    It takes the gestures or signs  as input and identifies it's meaning.
    Computer Vision is the primary technology used in this software for real -time applications
   
    Real -world solutions: Big help for people who can only talk in sign-languages,
                           Other People can easily understand the gestures made.
                           
                           
                           Technology used:
                            .Framework used is MEDIAPIPE developed by google.
                            .Convolutional Neural Networks, also known as convnets, 
                              a type of deep-learning model almost universally used in computer vision applications.
                            .We can  apply convnets to image-classification problemsâ€”in particular those involving small training datasets.
