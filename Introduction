1. Introduction
 To establish a communication or interaction
with Deaf and Mute people is of utter importance
nowadays. These people interact through hand
gestures or signs. Gestures are basically the
physical action form performed by a person to
convey some meaningful information. Gestures are
a powerful means of communication among
humans. In fact gesturing is so deeply rooted in our
communication that people often continue
gesturing when speaking on the telephone. There
are various signs which express complex meanings
and recognising them is a challenging task for
people who have no understanding for that
language.
It becomes difficult finding a well experienced
and educated translator for the sign language every
time and everywhere but human-computer
interaction system for this can be installed
anywhere possible. The motivation for developing
such helpful application came from the fact that it
would prove to be of utmost importance for
socially aiding people and how it would help
increasingly for social awareness as well. The
remarkable ability of the human vision is the
gesture recognition, it is noticeable mainly in deaf
people when they communicating with each other
via sign language and with hearing people as well.
In this paper we take up one of the social
challenges to give this set of mass a permanent
solution in communicating with normal human
beings.
Sign language is categorized in accordance to
regions like Indian, American, Chinese, Arabic and
so on and researches on hand gesture recognition,
pattern recognitions, image processing have been
carried by supposedly countries as well to improve
the applications and bring them to the best levels.
